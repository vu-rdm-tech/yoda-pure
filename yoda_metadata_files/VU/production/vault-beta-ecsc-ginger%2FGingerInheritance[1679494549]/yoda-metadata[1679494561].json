    "Description": "These datasets contains the data and R codes from the article entitled 'Dominant gingers – discovery and inheritance of a new shell polymorphism in the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis'. In this study, we tested if newly discovered shell colour polymorphism, called Ginger, is inherited by a single locus Mendelian mode. In addition, we examined if the life history of Ginger snails are different from wild types. Specifically, we measured and compared several life history traits between two morphs (G=Ginger, WT=Wild Type), including body size, onset of egg laying, fecundity, and mating behaviour. Moreover, we scored the phenotypes of self-fertilised and outcrossed offspring, in order to determine the inheritance mode of Ginger phenotype. The R codes are for making graphs and testing hypotheses. Please find more details in README.txt in the directory. ",
